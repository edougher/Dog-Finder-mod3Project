# Dog Finder

* Mod 3 Project by Aaron, and Jake

* This project renders a single-page Vanilla.js front-end application and uses a Ruby on Rails back-end to persist data.
* The database is seeded with data fetched from https://thedogapi.com.
* Data is rendered to a card where the name, breed, and image is displayed.
* A user can create a dog card by supplying a name, breed, as well as an image url.
