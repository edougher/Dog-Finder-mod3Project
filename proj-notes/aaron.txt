I set up the folder structure. The main directory is /mod-3-proj.
This folder contains /frontend and /backend folder. The /backend contains
the rails api which is called /mod-3-proj-api. For the api I uncommented the
cors gem, ran the bundler, and added the neccesary code in the config/application.rb
file on lines 27-35.
I used this for a reference:
